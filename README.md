These are R files that I've used as a civil engineer

**GMPS.R** 
This is a quick little script in R used to simplify the modeling the flow of water through a storm sewer network. 

**GPMS_test_data.csv**  
A test storm system used to test GMPS.R, use this basic layout for future systems.

**Water Main.xlsm**
A simple excel file used to generate a report that calculates the pressure drop of a water main system.
